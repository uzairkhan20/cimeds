                    <h2>Education quality principles</h2>
                    <p>The Education Quality Procedure describes CIMEDSâ€™s education quality framework. Central to the framework is the education quality cycle which supports the systematic collection and use of qualitative information and quantitative data
                        to monitor impact, identify improvement opportunities and judge the effectiveness of quality enhancement actions.</p>
                    <p>To ensure that education quality enhancement and assurance processes are sustainable and cost effective, they will be embedded in existing systems and practices and will utilize existing sources of information wherever possible.</p>
                    <p>Roles and accountabilities for implementation of the education quality framework will be assigned and clearly communicated to assist in developing a culture of continuous improvement.</p>
                    <p>The outcomes of education quality enhancement and assurance processes will be communicated to students, staff and other stakeholders, thereby ensuring ongoing engagement in the delivery of a quality education experience.</p>

                    <p>Dissemination channels include formal reporting channels, quality action plans, targeted communications, feedback and the student learning system. </p>

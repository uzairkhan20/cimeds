                    <p>The high cost of a private medical education is a concern for many students. St. George’s University’s School of Medicine is approved for its students to participate in the US Direct Loan Program and, in addition, the School of Medicine
                        offers a variety of scholarships to help defray the costs of medical education. If paying for medical school has you concerned, please explore this page for financial aid options, including US federal student aid, scholarships
                        for academic excellence, and need-based scholarships generally for international students.</p>
                    <p>The Office of Financial Aid administers the financial aid available to St. George’s University students, assists in financial planning, budgeting, and completion of the application process; and counsels students regarding management
                        of their educational debt.</p>
                    <p>
                        The majority of financial aid is received in the form of loans that are to be repaid after the student finishes his or her studies.</p>
